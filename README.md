## 📊 Dataset Description
- 📁 **Total Records:** 3,000 transactions  
- 🧩 **Dimensions:** 7 categorical attributes  
- 📐 **Measures:** 7 numerical attributes  
- 🔍 **Granularity:** Transaction-level data  
- 🗂 **Data Type:** Structured (Excel format)

### 🧱 Key Attributes
**Dimensions**
- Transaction ID  
- Customer ID  
- Merchant Category  
- Transaction Type  
- City / Region  
- Card Type  
- Fraud Flag (Yes / No)  

**Measures**
- Transaction Amount  
- Fraud Risk Score
