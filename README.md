# Credit Card Fraud Detection & Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data to identify fraud patterns, high-risk segments, and behavioral anomalies. The dataset contains transactional, customer, and risk-related attributes designed to simulate real-world fraud detection scenarios.  
The objective is to support **risk mitigation, fraud prevention, and decision-making** using data visualization and analytics.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Total Records:** 3,000 transactions  
- **Dimensions:** 7 categorical attributes  
- **Measures:** 7 numerical attributes  
- **Granularity:** Transaction-level data  
- **Data Type:** Structured (Excel format)

### Key Attributes
**Dimensions**
- Transaction ID  
- Customer ID  
- Merchant Category  
- Transaction Type  
- City / Region  
- Card Type  
- Fraud Flag (Yes / No)

**Measures**
- Transaction Amount  
- Fraud Risk Score  
- Transaction Count  
- Average Spend  
- Fraud Loss Amount  
- Customer Age  
- Account Tenure

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public** – Data visualization & dashboarding  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data storage and preprocessing  
- **Calculated Fields & Parameters** – Risk scoring and filtering  
- **Interactive Dashboards** – Drill-down and trend analysis  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High-value transactions contribute disproportionately to total fraud loss  
- Certain merchant categories show consistently higher fraud rates  
- Fraud risk increases with abnormal transaction frequency patterns  
- Specific cities and regions act as recurring fraud hotspots  
- Newer accounts exhibit higher fraud vulnerability compared to long-tenured users  

---

## 💼 Use Cases
- **Banking & Financial Institutions:** Fraud monitoring and risk assessment  
- **Risk & Compliance Teams:** Identifying vulnerable customer segments  
- **Business Analysts:** Understanding transaction behavior patterns  
- **Fraud Operations Teams:** Prioritizing alerts based on risk score  

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
- Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transaction Comparison  
- Risk Heatmap by City / Region  
- High-Risk Merchant Category Analysis  
- Transaction Amount Distribution  
- Fraud Trend Over Time  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time transaction streaming data  
- Apply machine learning models for predictive fraud scoring  
- Add time-series granularity (hour/day level)  
- Enhance customer profiling with behavioral metrics  
- Connect with SQL or cloud data sources for scalability  

---

## 🧠 Important Notes & Assumptions
- Dataset is **synthetic but realistic**, created for learning and demonstration  
- Fraud flags are pre-labeled for analytical exploration  
- Risk score is assumed to be derived from internal fraud logic  
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is included  

---

## 📎 Project Value
This project demonstrates:
- Strong understanding of **fraud analytics concepts**
- Hands-on expertise in **Tableau visual design**
- Ability to convert raw data into **actionable insights**
- Real-world problem-solving approach suitable for client presentations
